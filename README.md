# Pong

A simple recreation of Pong with mouse and keyboard controls, multiplayer capability, and a basic AI.

## Controls

### Menu

In the start menu, Up and Down Arrow Keys will move you through the menu and press Enter to confirm your choice.  

You can change the way you control the paddle by toggling Mouse Control ON or OFF.  

You can also enable a second human player to play with you or to select difficulty of the AI that you will be playing against.

### Game

Depending on your choice of controls, use the Up and Down Arrow Keys or the Mouse to move the paddle up and down.

Score is not kept and you can quit at any time by pressing the Q key.

The game plays exactly how you would expect classic Pong to play.

Challenge yourself with the hardest AI to test your skills.

Have fun!
